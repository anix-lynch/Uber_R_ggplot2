## 🌐 Project Overview

R is a language designed for statistical computing and data analysis, and **ggplot2** is one of the most powerful visualization libraries in R. In this project, we’ll analyze Uber data for New York City by exploring trip data across hours, days, and months. We’ll apply filters and grouping techniques to uncover patterns, and we’ll visualize these patterns using ggplot2. Additionally, we’ll map the trip data geographically to add more context and insight.
